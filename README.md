- [ ] [Java Script - For validation](https://github.com/Piyush-Tilokani/pre-joining-training/tree/main/client_side_programming/src/js)

### Integrating client and server side
- [ ] Servlets, JSP and mapping servlets (web.xml or annotation)  
- [ ] Different http methods and status codes.  
- [ ] Create a simple web application (dynamic web project in eclipse) which will display hello world. Add tomcat server to host the application. Familiarize with the structure of dynamic projects.
- [ ] Create a simple web application with login and registration form using JSP and Servlet. On successful login it must welcome the user. If the user is new he/she needs to register. Add a logout button on welcome page. On logout, the user should be directed again to the login page. If user enters incorrect password a proper message should be displayed and login form must be displayed again.
- [ ] The required validations are to be added using JavaScript
