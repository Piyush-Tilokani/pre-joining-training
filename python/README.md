# Python Training Modules

This directory contains Python scripts and practice examples covering foundational to intermediate Python programming concepts.

## Development Environment

| Tool     | Version     |
|----------|-------------|
| Python   | 3.12.2      |
| VS Code  | 1.101.1     |

Ensure that Python is properly installed and its `bin/` (or `Scripts/`) directory is added to your systemâ€™s environment variables.

## Getting Started

To run these Python files locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Piyush-Tilokani/pre-joining-training.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the python directory:
   ```bash
   cd pre-joining-training/python
   ```

3. Open the folder in VS Code:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

4. Run any file individually using the terminal or the "Run" button in VS Code:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```
